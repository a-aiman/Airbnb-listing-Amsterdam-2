# Airbnb-listing-Amsterdam-2
Second part of Airbnb listing Amsterdam project explicitly using Pandas Python library 
in preprocessing, merging and cleaning (dealing with non-null or missing values, correcting/converting data types), 
as well as removing/dropping data from the Airbnb listing Amsterdam dataset to omit data irrevelent to our question/goal
and forming better insights and answers to (business) questions.
This project (week 2) is in fulfillment of CoRise Python for Data Science Certification.

The project is then deployed using Streamlit making an app that visualizes the dataset as a DataFrame and even comes with a filter option,
this can be accessed through:
